During the summer, there's a program that brings over a hundred people to stay at Camp P훮lehua (Makakilo) for two weeks. 

My culinary teacher from high school would help run the kitchen and I volunteered to help during this time. I felt that it would be a good experience to do volunteer work to gain new skills and be in a new environment.

I helped with cooking breakfast, lunch, dinner, and serving to the people staying there. This experience allowed me to learn how to work with others that I only just met and being felxible to help where it was needed. Communication was also important to make sure that things were done at the right time and that everything was ready when people came in to eat. 

What I've learned from participating is that, it doesn't matter what you're actually doing. But rather, thinking about what you can gain from the experience. I always like to put in 110% effort in anything that I do, and try to reflect on what I've learned and how I can use it in the future. Communication and flexibility goes a long way in any career and I'm always eager to improving those skills and this experience helped contribute to improving my skills.
