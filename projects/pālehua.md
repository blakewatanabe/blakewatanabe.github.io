During the summer, there's a program that brought over a hundred people to stay at Camp P훮lehua (Makakilo) for two weeks. 

My culinary teacher from high school would help run the kitchen and I volunteered to help during this time. 

I helped with cooking breakfast, lunch, dinner, and serving to the people staying there. This experience allowed me to learn how to work with others that I only just met and being felxible to help where it was needed. Communication was also important to make sure that things were done at the right time and that everything was ready when people came in to eat.
