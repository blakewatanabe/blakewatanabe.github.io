A new start for me A new start for me, I start my first semester at University of Hawaii at Manoa. As a junior, I’ve worked on various homework assignments and Java was the first coding language that I learned. I’ve worked with Java for two semesters and by the end of the year, I was starting to get a good grasp on the ins and outs of how Java works and what it’s capable of. But starting the next semester, I had to put Java on the shelf for a bit and work with C and C++ language. During the first half of the semester, we were asked to write a short response on what our opinions of C compared to Java. Honestly, at the time I didn’t really know how to answer this as we covered only the basics of what we already knew is Java, just in a new language. When I finished the semester though, I was able to come to a conclusion that C/C++ gave you more freedom to how you want to write your code with less limitations/restrictions that came with Java. While that’s a good thing, it’s something I feel that I would need more practice to be confident with using C because since there’s more freedom, there’s more room for errors. C felt a little outdated in my opinion. 

Starting this semester at UH Manoa, we kick it off using JavaScript. Even though it has just been a couple of weeks, my initial impression of JavaScript is that…I just like it. To quickly get jumpstarted and understand the basics of how JavaScript works, during the first week we had to work on about 150 tasks learning what we already know how to do but in the JavaScript language. Certain parts of the syntax and keywords feel somewhat similar to me because of my previous experience with Java, but the overall syntax feels like there are less restrictions that allow coding flow more freely and easier. An example of this is how it isn’t necessary to declare what type of array you want. Instead, you’re able to mix different types of variables, objects, or inner arrays into a single array. While something like this is nice to have, I feel like I need to be really attentive to these kinds of things that exist with JavaScript. Like I mentioned with C language, more freedoms/shortcuts can cause many more errors if I’m not fully aware/fully understanding what is happening in the computer. Don’t take it for granted.

As I look forward, I can see myself really liking JavaScript. I hope that/will strive to really understand the new things that I learn this semester so that I can confidently take what I’ve learn at apply to anything that I may come across in the future. Even though I really like the look of JavaScript right now, my feelings might change throughout the semester as I fully understand how it works by working on more complex assignments/projects. Or it might not change and I come to love it even more. But I’m always open to learning new languages as it would help contribute to my goal of improving my skills for my future career.
