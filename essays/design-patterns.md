## "First they're sour."


I would like to start off by stating that during my Spring 2024 semester at UH Manoa, I’m one of those people whos been using design patterns and not realizing that we have been using design patterns all along (Shame on me!). BUT, I have a valid excuse! It was all a part of the learning process! We were exposed to design patterns and getting experience with them first so that later, it will make more sense when learning about the concept of design patterns. Or maybe I heard my professor wrong, being a selective listener to where it would justify me not knowing the difference between “Pattern Designs” (like on a rug)  and “Design Patterns” (the cool one, because now I know what it is). 

After learning about what the concept of design patterns is for, it made me think of [this old video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HRjTeM4N80) of this man who was cleaning a travelator in an “efficient” way. Okay, maybe not efficient since he only covered the top half of the glass. But that solution was a simpler way (in a sense where he didn’t have to move) for a problem that all the cleaners at the airport had to deal with and walk all the way down and back to clean. Those travelators can also be quite long, and according to [this website](https://www.dimensions.com/element/moving-walkway-inclined-double#:~:text=Inclined%20pit%20depths%20are%20commonly,(100%2D200%20m)), a typical length is 100 meters – 200 meters. 


## "Then they're sweet."


Okay, that’s enough with being a bit dramatic. But as you can tell from my statements earlier, it has been a bit of a rough start with UI frameworks. Though, I’m starting to understand Bootstrap 5 little by little. And it’s not just with UI frameworks, but also with HTML. Prior to the past couple weeks, I had no experience with HTML or CSS and learning about it has been very interesting to see what goes on with developing a website. Seeing and/or using amazingly, well-crafted websites always amazed me. I knew that building a website wouldn’t be that easy, but now I give web developers even more credit. I’m still trying to get used to HTML and understand all the intricate details, which I know isn’t going to just happen overnight. Then learning how to use UI frameworks like Bootstrap 5, which enhances the user experience with new ways to code in HTML, will also just take a bit for me to get used to. 

Even though I’m still in the “sour phase”, I can easily see the “sweet phase” and how it really improves the user experience when developing a website. With UI frameworks being prewritten code of UI components and interfaces, it can allow developers to create nice looking websites quicker and easier. From what I can tell so far, HTML has a lot of attributes that contribute to each element of a website. So being able to use custom classes provided by a framework just allows you to get the result that you want with shorter steps. But of course, you must learn how to use the UI framework first, and that’s the obstacle that I’m currently facing. 

## "Not Gone."


With all of that said, I will continue to put a lot of effort into learning not just UI frameworks, but also HTML and CSS. Before these past couple weeks, I didn’t know how it felt when you’re on the other end, being a developer who created a beautiful website that many people enjoy using. Well…I still don’t know that feeling. BUT, doing assignments to create simple websites felt satisfying to get a result that I was trying to reach. Sort of like that same feeling when you get a program working the way that you wanted it too. If it felt like that for just a small assignment in college, I can’t imagine how nice it must feel building a masterpiece for many people to enjoy.
